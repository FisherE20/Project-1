# Travel App

As a traveler, I want to search a travel destination.  
When I find where I want to go to, I'm presented with pictures of the location and the currency rate.  
With pictures of the location and the currency used, I know what to expect.  

## Criteria
- When I search for any location in the world, I'm presented with pictures of the location and costs of services.  
- The pictures must relate to the location searched for.  
- The cost of basic services at that locales currency rate (i.e. Hotel room cost, car rentals, basic spending) converted from USD.  
- If possible, I would like to know what the weather forecast (5 days out) will be at the locale I'm looking at visiting.
